#Objective
#In this challenge, we practice calculating the mean, median, and mode. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

#Task
#Given an array, , of  integers, calculate and print the respective mean, median, and mode on separate lines. If your array contains more than one modal value, choose the numerically smallest one.

#Note: Other than the modal value (which will always be an integer), your answers should be in decimal form, rounded to a scale of  decimal place (i.e., ,  format).

#Input Format

#The first line contains an integer, , denoting the number of elements in the array.
#The second line contains  space-separated integers describing the array's elements.

#Constraints

#, where  is the  element of the array.

#Output Format

#Print  lines of output in the following order:

#Print the mean on a new line, to a scale of  decimal place (i.e., , ).
#Print the median on a new line, to a scale of  decimal place (i.e., , ).
#Print the mode on a new line; if more than one such value exists, print the numerically smallest one.

    median = (med1 + med2)/2
else:
    median = arr[n//2]

    countL.append(0)
    countL[i] = (arr.count(arr[i]))
    maxl = max(countL)
    mode = arr[countL.index(maxl)]
